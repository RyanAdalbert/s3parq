## Running Scripts

This project uses the idea of having basic (mostly) scripts to do tasks like testing, building, and serving applications - this idea was taken from https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all. These scripts live in the /script directory and MUST be executed from the base directory of this repository.
