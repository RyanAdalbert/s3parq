# Core Pipeline Utilities

## What is Core?

Core offers a suite of utilites which allow users to create, modify, and manage [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of data transformations captured in [Jupyter](https://airflow.apache.org/) notebooks. Individual transformations can quickly and easily be added, removed, modified, and reordered within a given DAG.
