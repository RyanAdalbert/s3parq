Currently this is a simple stub API which takes requests at the actual API's endpoints and returns 200 responses for frontend testing.

By default, the flask development server is set to run on port 5000. Be sure to not access this URL directly as it is not an endpoint supported by the API.

Supported endpoints:
/config_api
/config_api/login
