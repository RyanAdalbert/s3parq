    "- **singular in purpose:** good transforms do one and only one thing, and handle all known cases for that thing. \n",
    "- **repeatable:** transforms should be written in a way that they can be run against the same dataset an infinate number of times and get the same result every time. \n",
    "- **easy to read:** 99 times out of 100, readable, clear code that runs a little slower is more valuable than a mess that runs quickly. \n",
    "- **No 'magic numbers':** if a variable or function is not instantly obvious as to what it is or does, without context, maybe consider renaming it."
